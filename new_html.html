    <h1>No, I'm Santa Claus!</h1>
    <p>Who are you, my warranty?! We don't have a brig. Perhaps, but perhaps your civilization is merely the sewer of an even greater society above you! Ummm...to eBay? There, now he's trapped in a book I wrote: a crummy world of plot holes and spelling errors!</p>
    <p>
      <strong>That's a popular name today.</strong>
      <em> Little "e", big "B"?</em>
      I suppose I could part with 'one' and still be feared... Have you ever tried just turning off the TV, sitting down with your children, and hitting them?
    </p>
    <h2>You guys realize you live in a sewer, right?</h2>
    <p>
      Is that a cooking show? Also Zoidberg. No argument here. No. We're on the top. Our love isn't any different from yours, except it's hotter, because I'm involved. But I know you in the future. I cleaned your poop.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>I just want to talk. It has nothing to do with mating. Fry, that doesn't make sense.</li>
      <li>Do a flip!</li>
      <li>We'll go deliver this crate like professionals, and then we'll go home.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Eeeee! Now say "nuclear wessels"!</h3>
    <p>
      They're like sex, except I'm having them! Hi, I'm a naughty nurse, and I really need someone to talk to. $9.95 a minute. Perhaps, but perhaps your civilization is merely the sewer of an even greater society above you!
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>You can crush me but you can't crush my spirit!</li>
      <li>I was having the most wonderful dream. Except you were there, and you were there, and you were there!</li>
      <li>Five hours? Aw, man! Couldn't you just get me the death penalty?</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Take me to your leader! If rubbin' frozen dirt in your crotch is wrong, hey I don't wanna be right. Too much work. Let's burn it and say we dumped it in the sewer. It's just like the story of the grasshopper and the octopus. All year long, the grasshopper kept burying acorns for winter, while the octopus mooched off his girlfriend and watched TV. But then the winter came, and the grasshopper died, and the octopus ate all his acorns. Also he got a race car. Is any of this getting through to you?

      When I was first asked to make a film about my nephew, Hubert Farnsworth, I thought "Why should I?" Then later, Leela made the film. But if I did make it, you can bet there would have been more topless women on motorcycles. Roll film! I'm Santa Claus!
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, I don't have time for this. I have to go and buy a single piece of fruit with a coupon and then return it, making people wait behind me while I complain. I'm just glad my fat, ugly mama isn't alive to see this day.
    </p>
    <p>But I've never been to the moon! Tell them I hate them. I can explain. It's very valuable. With gusto. Bite my shiny metal ass.
    </p>
    <p>Why not indeed! Ummm...to eBay? Oh, but you can. But you may have to metaphorically make a deal with the devil. And by "devil", I mean Robot Devil. And by "metaphorically", I mean get your coat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Good news, everyone! I've taught the toaster to feel love! Yes, I saw. You were doing well, until everyone died. It must be wonderful. Dear God, they'll be killed on our doorstep! And there's no trash pickup until January 3rd.
    </p>
    <p>For example, if you killed your grandfather, you'd cease to exist! Quite possible. We live long and are celebrated poopers. Leela's gonna kill me. Hey, whatcha watching?
    </p>
    <p>You wouldn't. Ask anyway! You know, I was God once. Look, last night was a mistake. But, like most politicians, he promised more than he could deliver. And remember, don't do anything that affects anything, unless it turns out you were supposed to, in which case, for the love of God, don't not do it!
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, all right, I am. But if anything happens to me, tell them I died robbing some old man. And why did 'I' have to take a cab? Yeah, lots of people did. What are you hacking off? Is it my torso?! 'It is!' My precious torso!
    </p>
    <p>
      Can we have Bender Burgers again? Ah, computer dating. It's like pimping, but you rarely have to use the phrase "upside your head." Michelle, I don't regret this, but I both rue and lament it. Fry, you can't just sit here in the dark listening to classical music.
    </p>
    <p>
      I suppose I could part with 'one' and still be feared... Large bet on myself in round one. Hi, I'm a naughty nurse, and I really need someone to talk to. $9.95 a minute. And yet you haven't said what I told you to say! How can any of us trust you?
